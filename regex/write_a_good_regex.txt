	1) Preprocessing the Text:
	Convert all text to lowercase to ensure case-insensitive matching.
	Remove punctuation marks, symbols, and special characters that may affect pattern matching.
	Remove any irrelevant or noisy information, such as URLs or numbers.
2) Enhancing the Lexicon:
	Expand your hateful words list by including synonyms, slang terms, and 
variations commonly used to express hate or negativity.
	Consider incorporating sentiment lexicons or word lists specifically designed for 
sentiment analysis, such as the NRC Word-Emotion Association Lexicon or the AFINN-111 wordlist.

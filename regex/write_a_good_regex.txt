1) Preprocessing the Text:
	Convert all text to lowercase to ensure case-insensitive matching.
	Remove punctuation marks, symbols, and special characters that may affect pattern matching.
	Remove any irrelevant or noisy information, such as URLs or numbers.
2) Enhancing the Lexicon:
	Expand your hateful words list by including synonyms, slang terms, and 
variations commonly used to express hate or negativity.
	Consider incorporating sentiment lexicons or word lists specifically designed for 
sentiment analysis, such as the NRC Word-Emotion Association Lexicon or the AFINN-111 wordlist.
3) Constructing Regular Expressions:
	Compile a regular expression pattern that matches the hateful words and their variations.
	Consider using word boundaries (\b) to ensure exact word matches and avoid partial matches.
	Utilize case-insensitive matching (re.IGNORECASE or re.I) to capture both uppercase and lowercase instances.
	Group synonymous words or variations together using the pipe symbol (|) for an alternative match.
